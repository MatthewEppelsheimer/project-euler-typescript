// First solution attempt was to generate products from factors, then check if they were palindromes. The challenge with this was determining if a found solution was the largest: I didn't crack the nut of how to generate factor pairs whose product would always be less than the previous.

// So I switched to generating large-to-small palindromes, and looking for factor pairs.
