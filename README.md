# Project Euler solutions in Node/TypeScript

My solutions to [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net) problems. Code calisthenics.

## Why share?

There's zero reason to cheat off my solutions -- what do you have to gain? My reason is simply to be open about my problem solving approach, logical thinking, and coding style. I don't expect you to be interested unless you're considering hiring me.

;-)

## WTH is going on in src/utilities/test.ts?

I thought it would be interesting and educational to explore rolling my own suite of unit test tools. I don't think for a second the current state of it is any good. (It's atrocious.) But I've accomplished what I hoped -- learned a ton from it! -- and expect to keep iterating on it a bit to learn more.

## Usage

1. Update `src/problems/#.ts` import in `index.ts`
2. `npm run watch` runs nodemon

## Notes to self

_Houskeeping todos_

- [ ] run prettier on precommit
- [ ] rework `test()`
